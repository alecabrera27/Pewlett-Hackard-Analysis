Analysis with SQL
---

## Overview
Using SQL, we will analyze several csv files from a company that is offering a retirement package for those employees who meet certain criteria and looking toward the future, the company wants to plan ahead and think about which positions will need to be filled in the near future.
Using the data provided by the HR department we will help them answer the following questions: 

Who will be retiring in the next few years and how many positions will the company need to fill? 
What would happen to a company if they didnâ€™t look ahead and prepare for this many vacancies?
